# Magento 2 to Drip Connector

This is a Magento 2 extension to connect a Magento store with the [Drip ECRM](https://www.drip.com/).

For the Magento 1 extension, go here: https://github.com/DripEmail/magento-m1-extension

## Installation

The official way to install this extension is [from the Magento store](https://marketplace.magento.com/drip-connect.html). Instructions can be found under the integration page in your Drip account, or [in the knowledge base](https://my.drip.com/docs/manual/magento/magento-setup).

## Development

There is a simple Docker-based development environment in `devtools_m2/`. The readme in there has more details.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

If the change is not specific to Magento 2, we need to backport everything to Magento 1. Generally, we have changes start in Magento 2 and then get backported rather than the other way around.
